- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeepSmeag, a future student starting university in the fall of 2021.
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in Machine Learning and its various subdomains at the moment, but anything software can catch my eye.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning independently and plan on working in Data Science and Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m planning on putting things I learn into practice by thinking up projects that can actually bring value to people (using ML if possible).
