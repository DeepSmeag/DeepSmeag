- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeepSmeag, a CS grad focused on web development (fullstack/backend) with an eye on the business use-case
- 👀 Big fan of ML/AI advancements, but bigger fan of building useful products.
- 💞️ My mission is to connect people with the right tools.

My current projects include end-to-end backend-focused web applications like web scrapers and analytics based on 3rd party APIs. They're built with horizontal scalability in mind.
