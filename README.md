- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeepSmeag, a Fullstack developer with an eye for entrepreneurship.
- ⚡ Right now I'm fastest with NextJS w/ TRPC (t3 stack) and NestJS
- 👀 Big fan of ML/AI advancements, but bigger fan of building useful products.
- 💞️ My mission is to connect people and information.
<!--- 📫---> 
My current projects include end-to-end backend-focused web applications like web scrapers and analytics based on 3rd party APIs. They're built with horizontal scalability in mind.
