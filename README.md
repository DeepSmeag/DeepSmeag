- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeepSmeag, a Computer Science student since the fall of 2021.
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in Machine Learning and its various subdomains, but anything software can catch my eye.
- 💞️ My mission is to connect people and information.
<!--- 📫---> 
- ⭐ In my free time: Music + daydreaming, searching for tools to ease my work, building my typing speed, filling my reading list with articles and not reading all of them.
<!---
DeepSmeag/DeepSmeag is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
